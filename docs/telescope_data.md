# Software Verification on Telescope Data #

We have verified the `scatfit` software with simulated and real FRB and pulsar data from the following radio telescopes.

*MeerKAT*

* TUSE total intensity
* TUSE high time-resolution voltage buffer data full polarisation

*NenuFAR*

* Standard folded pulsar mode data
* Folded dispersion-corrected data
