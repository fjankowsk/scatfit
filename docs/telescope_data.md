# Software Verification on Telescope Data #

We have verified the `scatfit` software with simulated and real FRB and pulsar data from the following radio telescopes.

*GMRT*

* Folded dispersion-corrected data in total intensity (PSRFITS)

*LOFAR*

* Single-station folded pulsar mode data from offline processing in full polarisation (Timer)

*MeerKAT*

* TUSE data snippets in total intensity (SIGPROC)
* TUSE high time-resolution voltage buffer data in full polarisation (Timer)

*NenuFAR*

* Standard folded pulsar mode data in full polarisation (PSRFITS)
* Folded dispersion-corrected data in total intensity (PSRFITS)
