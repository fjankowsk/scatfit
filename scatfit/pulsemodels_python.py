def bandintegrated_model(x, fluence, center, sigma, taus, dc, f_lo, f_hi, nfreq):
    """
    A true frequency band-integrated profile model.

    The total (sub-)band-integrated profile is the superposition (weighted sum or
    weighted mean) of several profiles that evolve with frequency across the bandwidth
    of the frequency (sub-)band, one for each frequency channel. Namely, the individual
    profiles evolve with frequency (scattering, pulse width, fluence). For large
    fractional bandwidths or at low frequencies (< 1 GHz), the profile evolution across
    the band cannot be neglected, i.e. the narrow-band approximation fails.

    We compute the frequency evolution across the band between `f_lo` and `f_hi` at
    `nfreq` centre frequencies. The total profile is then the weighted sum over the
    finite frequency grid. Ideally, one would use an infinitesimally narrow grid here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: ~np.array
        The running variable (time).
    fluence: float
        The fluence of the pulse, i.e. the area under it.
    center: float
        The mean of the Gaussian, i.e. its location.
    sigma: float
        The Gaussian standard deviation.
    taus: float
        The scattering time.
    dc: float
        The vertical offset of the profile from the baseline.
    f_lo: float
        The centre frequency of the lowest channel in the sub-band.
    f_hi: float
        The centre frequency of the highest channel in the sub-band.
    nfreq: int
        The number of centre frequencies to evaluate.
